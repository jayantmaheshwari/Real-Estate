This report is based on the study that was conducted over 20,000 rental properties in Texas, Florida, Georgia, and 
North Carolina and identifies 29 critical features that are functional indicators in predicting rent price. 
The raw dataset provided by the client includes hundreds of columns of information on rental properties ranging 
from property location to unit size. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations of the data uncovered anomalies 
present within variables as well as correlations between variables. Such findings led to the urge for using linear 
regression to test the observed patterns, and to potentially reveal unobserved ones. 

In preparation for modeling, the original data was cleaned, transformed, and then supplemented with external data 
that captures the demographics and affluency of the population in the area. A total of 24 numerical variables 
alongside six categorical variables were tested against average effective rent per square foot. Twenty-nine out 
of the thirty variables tested turned out to be significant indicators of rent.
Using the linear regression model as the foundation, an excel based price prediction tool prototype was developed 
for Centro (the client) that takes features of a rental property as input and calculates estimated rental income 
and suggests sale price as output. Centro can improve its return on investment by using this tool to find properties 
that are highly underpriced.
It is important to note that there are limitations to this study. In order to achieve better prediction accuracy, 
the client can work on improving data quality, including more data on properties or variables, and incorporating 
longitudinal data in future studies.
